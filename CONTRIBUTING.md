Welcome to the HandyGuide API project! We're excited to have you contribute to our open-source Django REST API. Your contributions help make the project better for everyone. Please take a moment to review and follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process.

## Code of Conduct

Before getting started, please read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to create a friendly, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub to your own account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.
3. Set up a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-branch
```

## Contributing

### 1. Submitting Changes

1. Make sure to work on your feature in your branch. Keep your changes focused on a single task or issue.
2. Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add a clear and concise commit message"
```

3. Push your changes to your GitHub fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-branch
```

4. Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository from your GitHub page.
5. Ensure your PR description explains the changes you made and why they are valuable.
6. The maintainers will review your code, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary. Be prepared to make updates to your PR based on feedback.

### 2. Coding Standards

1. Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
2. Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
3. Ensure your code is well-documented with clear comments where necessary.
4. Write unit tests for your code to maintain code quality and ensure it works as expected.

### 3. Testing

1. Run the existing test suite before making any changes to ensure all tests pass:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

2. Add new tests for your changes to prevent regressions and showcase expected behavior.

### 4. Pull Request Review

1. Be patient and responsive during the PR review process. Maintainers and other contributors have different schedules and time zones.
2. Address all review comments and discuss any suggested changes if needed.
3. Squash your commits into a coherent set of changes before merging, using `git rebase` if necessary.
